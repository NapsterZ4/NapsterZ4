| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Ciclon.AI](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/nasa_spaceapps)     | Our project aims to develop a new and innovative hurricane detection methodology based on deep learning.  Our algorithm is trained with  images provided by NASA’s aqua and terra satellites and associated with the NASA. |
| [Cataract detection](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/saturdays_second_edition) | Research for the Saturdays.AI Costa Rica community. This project is intended to use images of deep eyes to detect diseases related to the cataracts in the eyes. Actually, we made this prototype for [Ainnova Tech](https://www.ainnovatech.com/) and it receives investment to be deployed in Central America and Mexico. You can contact to rodrigo@ainnovatech.com to check the project and you can see in the website ainnovatech.com.<br />![Retinopathy diseases detection](https://www.ainnovatech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Group2182.png) |
| [Processing](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/processing)        | Folder to contains projects using processing language for autonomous agents and math modelling. |
| [Breast cancer research](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/cancer_investigation) | The algorithm is based on the gradient descent histograms to get the mainly characteristics from x-ray radiography images with people with breast cancer, get the structured data from the images and then apply the algorithm. |
| [Miner process](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/miner_proccess) | Get the mainly indicators from the operating systems like CPU, RAM and network resources using C and then upload it in real time using API's and Grafana. |
| [Quantum Computing](qiskit_quantum_code)                     | Notebooks related to quantum computing algorithms and projects using Qiskit language and IBM Quantum. It doesn't includes the research ¿Es la computación cuántica el fin de la computación clásica? and were indexed in the LOGOS magazine in Costa Rica. You can see it here [Logos](https://biblioteca.ulead.ac.cr/sites/default/files/Logos_Vol2_No1.pdf) in page 69.|
| [High performance computing](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/HPC_LEAD) | Projects made using C and the Cenat Super Computer to process advanced algorithms like molecular dynamics for the Costa Rica National High Technology Center. |
| [Insurance](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/ml_insurace_ainnovatech) | Machine learning applied to insurance predictions.           |
| [Hand track demo](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/handTrack_demo) | Demo related to the interaction machine for ATMs using only the hands. |
| [Covid datasets](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/covid19_research_datasets) | Private research with Tomas de Camino, comparing the datasets from other countries in Europe to make algorithms to know the best practices to mitigate the infections caused by coronavirus in Costa Rica. you can contact to tdecamino@cenfotec.ac.cr |
| [Python course](https://github.com/NapsterZ4/python_basic_course) | Simple python course for beginners.                          |
